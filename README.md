### Requirements

Required technologies: HTML, CSS

### Design

As this is my first project the design has been influenced by the ”Love Running” - project. The code from the footer has been borrowed from that project (commented in the code). My design of the header and hero-header has also been influenced by that project.

My aim has been to create a clean looking website where there is a balance between colors, images and functionality.

The Nacka Tomato Society website is a single page website divided in to sections. Menu is fixed on top in order to ensure easy navigation between the sections.

#### Colours

The colour palette was created using [Coolors](https://fontawesome.com/).
